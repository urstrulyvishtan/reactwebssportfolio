  An IoT project where it can be used for clearing traffic in the signals when ambulance gets in the path of the signal within 500M.
  it will be detected and controlled by microwave sensor and receiver. And micro Arduino or raspberry PI is used to develop further more.

  due to the COVID outbreak, many plans are being canceled so to reorganize those plans and send the concerned persons the notification or messages.
  data science-based calendar which searches particular regions curfew timings and allocate appointments accordingly.
  IBM Watson is used to collect data from the Internet and used Jupyter notebook to develop. For every 20mins to check of the curfew timings and status update to change the appointments.

  We Used Microsoft Xbox Sensor to craft a perfect hand gestured mouse replacement.
 used Machine Learning models to train the whole system to read hand fingers and movements using Python.
 Machine Learning Model gave a 80-85% success rate enough to recognise hand.

  Near Field Communication (NFC) and one time password (OTP) upheld M- Attendance structure for little scale association.
  Traditionally employee needs to maintain the enrolment records for participation. This routine requires time and exertion, compromising on the working time.
  Expansion to this, a few employees exploits the benefit of low- security attendance framework and test the participation of the representative who is not available in the office.
